# extra-safety-valve-V1

Upgraded version of LMNC's safety valve. 

Smaller, with CV inputs for tone and gain.

My idea is to have connecting point for vactrols at the CV inputs, the builder can decide what vactrol he puts in to have different responses (even a DIY vactrol). Some resistor in series might be needed after the vactrol.

Everything is untested !
